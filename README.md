## Portfolio / Project Site


The site serves as a host for small web games I've made in JavaScript
  I try to keep their code updated with whatever new information I learn along the way

The landing site itself is being updated to include a CSS Grid - based layout, & to follow a mobile-first design approach
  This will hopefully make my games easier to make accessible to mobile users




### TODO:

  - Update HTML & CSS for better responsive images
      - Both for viewport sizes & for varying display qualities of screens
  - Upgrade layout to be based on CSS Grid
      - Display mobile ver. of site to browsers no supporting CSS Grid
  - Improve user experience with Print Style Sheets
